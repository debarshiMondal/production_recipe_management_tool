The KOT generated as a PDF can be printed by thermal KOT printers, but you might need to adjust the dimensions to match the specifications of the thermal printer.

Steps to Adjust Dimensions for Thermal Printers:
Determine Printer Specifications:

Check the width of the thermal printer paper. Common widths are 58mm and 80mm.
Set PDF Page Size:

Adjust the page size in the PDF generation code to match the width of the thermal printer paper. For example:
For 58mm width: pdf = FPDF(orientation='P', unit='mm', format=(58, 297))
For 80mm width: pdf = FPDF(orientation='P', unit='mm', format=(80, 297))
Adjust Content Layout:

Ensure the content fits within the width by adjusting font sizes and cell widths accordingly.
Test Printing:

Generate a sample KOT and test print it on the thermal printer. Adjust the dimensions and layout based on the test print results.
By setting the correct page size and ensuring the content fits within the specified width, the KOT will be compatible with thermal printers and print correctly.
